        <h4 style="text-align: left">What We Do</h4>At Time Travel Trading we have acquired an exclusive contract with Jiffy Labs to provide time sensitive stock trades. So what does that mean? Every single brokerage firm in the world is able to let their clients purchase stocks in real time. Which means you click the buy button and you’ve got the money, boom you have just purchased stocks in real time at the current price of that stock. At Time Travel Trading we think that’s so boring. So we’re offering something a little different. We are the only brokerage firm in the world, possibly the known universe that lets you purchase a stock at a stock price in the past for up to 30 days in the past. Enabling our clients to immediately realize a gain or loss on their stock purchases. Since you already know historical stock prices you can guarantee your investment in those stocks. If you’re curious to know more about just how we are able to offer such a unique service, then read on.</div>

        <h4 style="text-align: left">In The Beginning</h4>Due to recent scientific breakthroughs Jiffy Labs has cracked the case and figured out how to travel in time. The first breakthrough came back in 2013 with the invention of the first prototype, the Jiffy I. With this new technology Jiffy Lab scientists were able to figure out how to transport one person forward in time. Since the time space portal created by the Jiffy I was only big enough to fit a single person in a tiny capsule, our scientists worked tirelessly to increase the size of the time space portal. Here’s an interesting <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/time-travel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article on the Jiffy I</a>.<br><br>In the summer of 2017 our team of scientists developed the Jiffy II and figured out how to increase the size of the time space portal so that it was large enough to fit a vessel that could carry two people. However, up to this point it was still only possible to travel forward in time and not backwards in time. But that was all about to change.

      <div class="text">
        <h4 style="text-align: left">How does it Work?</h4>Fast forward to present time. We did it! With the Jiffy III we can now go forward and backwards in time. But there are restrictions due to the amount of energy required to open a time space portal to a point of time in the past. Much like the headwinds from west to east due to the rotation of the planet earth, an airplane flying west into those headwinds is going to consume more fuel and will fly a little slower than the same airplane flying east with the headwinds at its back. The time space continuum works in much the same way. It requires far more energy to open and sustain a time space portal heading into the past then it does heading into the future. This is because the time space continuum is already heading in the direction of the future. So what does all that mean as it relates to time travel into the past? Due to the energy restrictions, at present we are only able to safely travel two people up to 30 days into the past.

        <h4 style="text-align: left">The future of Time Travel</h4>With time travel technology there are two things to focus on. The first is the size and stability of a time space portal. The second is the length of time we can open a time space portal. Currently, we are only able to travel up to 30 days into the past with a time space portal that can accommodate a vessel carrying two people.<br><br>Jiffy Labs is currently under a governmental contract with the United States of America to push this technology further. The objective of this contract is to solely focus on the size of the time space portal to accommodate a vessel that can carry more people. It seems the US is less interested in taking selfies with dinosaurs than they are in gaining a strategic military advantage on the battlefield. So Jiffy Labs current prototype, the Jiffy IV will focus on creating a larger time space portal at the expense of time travel duration. But don’t fret all you dinosaur lovers, I heard whisperings of tandem development of another prototype that will solely focus on the duration of time travel. That project as of yet is unnamed and yet to be officially announced. Stay tuned.</div>
